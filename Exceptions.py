IndexError: a list is indexed with an out-of-range number;
NameError: an unknown variable is used;
SyntaxError: the code can't be parsed properly;
TypeError: a function is called on a value of an inappropriate type;

Python has several other built-in exceptions, such as ZeroDivisionError and OSError. 
Third-party libraries also often define their own exceptions.
