Sequence types and mutability

A sequence type is a type of data in Python which is able to store more
than one value (or less than one, as a sequence may be empty),
and these values can be sequentially (hence the name) browsed,
element by element.

Mutable data can be freely updated at any time
Immutable data cannot be modified in this way.

 A tuple is an immutable sequence type.
 It can behave like a list, but it mustn't be modified in situ.
